== 5-6 OBJECTS AND CLASSES

=== What is an Object?
An object is a "container" that contains:

* Data/State (called *attributes*)
* Functionality/Behaviors (called *methods*)

.Example: A car has:
** State: brand, model, year
** Behavior: accelerate, brake, steer

=== Accessing Objects
Use dot notation:

[source,python]
----
my_car.brand = "Ferrari"
my_car.accelerate()
----

=== Classes
A class is a template/blueprint for creating objects.

In Python, everything is an object, including classes.

.Terminology:
* Class:: the "template" (also an object of type `type`).
* Instance:: object created from the class.

.Example:
[source,python]
----
class Person:
    pass

p = Person()  # instance of the Person class
----

=== Creating Classes
Use the `class` keyword:

[source,python]
----
class MyClass:
    pass
----

Even when empty, the class already has attributes and methods provided by Python (e.g., `__name__`).

=== Checking Types
* `type(obj)`: returns the class of the object.
* `isinstance(obj, Class)`: checks if the object is an instance of a class.

.Difference:
[source,python]
----
type(p) is Person       # True (compares identity)
isinstance(p, Person)   # True (also considers inheritance)
----

=== Tips and Precautions

.1. Differentiate Class vs Instance
The class is the template (type `type`).
The instance is the object created from the class.

.Example:
[source,python]
----
class Car:
    pass

c = Car()
type(Car)   # <class 'type'>
type(c)     # <class '__main__.Car'>
----

.2. Pre-defined Attributes
Empty classes already have attributes like `__name__` (class name).

*Do not overwrite `__dunder__` attributes without understanding their purpose.*

.3. Proper Use of `type()` and `isinstance()`
* Prefer `isinstance()` for type checking, as it considers inheritance.
* `type()` is more restrictive (does not consider subclasses).

.4. Classes Are Callables
Classes are callable (like functions), creating instances:

[source,python]
----
obj = MyClass()  # Calling the class creates an instance
----

.5. Meta Classes (Mentioned Only)
* Classes are created by meta classes (the "type of classes").
* The type of a class is `type`.
* Caution: Meta programming is advanced; avoid if not necessary.

.6. Objects vs Classes in Language
* In other languages (Java), "object" = instance, "class" = template.
* In Python, everything is an object, but maintain the conceptual distinction.

=== Practical Summary
* Objects = data + behaviors.
* Classes = templates for creating objects.
* Instances = objects created from classes.
* Use `.` to access attributes/methods.
* Use `isinstance()` for type checking.
* Remember: classes are also objects (of type `type`).

== 7-8 CLASS ATTRIBUTES

=== Class Attributes vs Instance Attributes
Class attributes belong to the class object itself, not to instances.

They are defined directly inside the class body.

.Example:
[source,python]
----
class Program:
    language = "Python"   # class attribute
    version = 3.6         # class attribute
----

=== Accessing Attributes
.Dot notation (common):
[source,python]
----
Program.language   # returns "Python"
----

.`getattr()` function (more flexible):
[source,python]
----
getattr(Program, "language")  # returns "Python"
getattr(Program, "x", "N/A")  # returns "N/A" if attribute doesn't exist
----

* Allows providing a default value if attribute is missing.
* Dot notation raises `AttributeError` if attribute doesn't exist.

=== Modifying Class Attributes
.Dot notation:
[source,python]
----
Program.version = 3.7
----

.`setattr()` function:
[source,python]
----
setattr(Program, "version", 3.7)
----

=== Dynamic Nature of Python
You can add new attributes to a class at runtime:

[source,python]
----
Program.x = 100  # New attribute added
----

You can delete attributes at runtime:

[source,python]
----
del Program.x                # Using del keyword
delattr(Program, "x")       # Using delattr() function
----

*Note: This works for user-defined classes, but not for most built-in types.*

=== Class State Storage
Class attributes are stored in a `__dict__` attribute (a namespace dictionary).

`__dict__` returns a mapping proxy (read-only view of the class namespace).

.Example:
[source,python]
----
Program.__dict__  # Shows all class attributes
----

*Important: Not all class properties are stored in `__dict__` (e.g., `__name__` is not in `__dict__`).*

=== Important Tips and Precautions

.1. Use Dot Notation for Simplicity
* Prefer dot notation when you know the attribute exists:
  `value = Program.language`
* Use `getattr()` only when you need a default value or dynamic attribute names.

.2. Dynamic Attribute Names
Use `getattr()`/`setattr()` when attribute names come from variables:

[source,python]
----
attr_name = "version"
value = getattr(Program, attr_name)
----

.3. Avoid Direct `__dict__` Access
Don't access attributes via `__dict__` in production code:

[source,python]
----
# ❌ Avoid:
value = Program.__dict__["language"]

# ✅ Use instead:
value = Program.language
value = getattr(Program, "language")
----

`__dict__` is useful for debugging but not for regular attribute access.

.4. Built-in Types Are Different
You cannot add/modify attributes on built-in types:

[source,python]
----
str.x = 100          # ❌ Fails
"hello".x = 100      # ❌ Fails
----

This only works with user-defined classes.

.5. Namespace Awareness
Remember that `__dict__` shows most but not all attributes.

Some special attributes (like `__name__`, `__bases__`) are stored elsewhere.

.6. Mapping Proxy is Read-Only
You cannot modify `__dict__` directly:

[source,python]
----
Program.__dict__["language"] = "Java"  # ❌ Raises TypeError
----

Always use `setattr()` or dot notation to modify attributes.

.7. Debugging with `__dict__`
Use `__dict__` to inspect class state during debugging:

[source,python]
----
print(Program.__dict__)  # See all stored attributes
----

=== Summary
* Class attributes are defined in the class body and belong to the class itself.
* Use dot notation for simple access, `getattr()`/`setattr()` for dynamic cases.
* Python allows runtime modification of class attributes (add/change/delete).
* Class state is stored in `__dict__` (a read-only mapping proxy).
* Don't rely on `__dict__` for regular attribute access—use it only for debugging.
* Built-in types behave differently from user-defined classes regarding attribute modification.

== 9-10 CALLABLE CLASS ATTRIBUTES

=== 1. Callable Class Attributes
Class attributes can be any object, including functions (callables).

Functions defined inside a class become callable attributes of the class.

.Example:
[source,python]
----
class Program:
    language = "Python"          # Data attribute
    
    def say_hello():             # Callable attribute
        print(f"Hello from {Program.language}")
----

=== 2. Accessing Callable Attributes
.Dot notation (recommended):
[source,python]
----
Program.say_hello()          # Call directly
func = Program.say_hello     # Get the function object
----

.`getattr()` function:
[source,python]
----
func = getattr(Program, "say_hello")
func()
----

.Direct dictionary access (not recommended for production):
[source,python]
----
func = Program.__dict__["say_hello"]
func()
----

=== 3. Important Distinction
* These are class attributes, NOT instance methods
* Called directly on the class, not on instances
* Defined without `self` parameter (not bound to instances)

=== Tips and Precautions

.1. Use Dot Notation for Production Code
[source,python]
----
# ✅ RECOMMENDED (clean, readable)
Program.say_hello()
func = Program.say_hello

# ❌ AVOID in production (too verbose, error-prone)
func = Program.__dict__["say_hello"]; func()
func = getattr(Program, "say_hello"); func()
----

.2. Remember: These Are Not Instance Methods
* No `self` parameter required
* Cannot access instance data (no `self`)
* Can only access class attributes

[source,python]
----
class Program:
    language = "Python"
    
    # ✅ CORRECT - accesses class attribute
    def say_hello():
        print(f"Hello from {Program.language}")
    
    # ❌ WRONG - self won't be passed
    def bad_method(self):  
        print("This won't work as class attribute call")
----

.3. Namespace Dictionary is for Debugging Only
* `Program.__dict__` shows both data and callable attributes
* Only use for debugging/inspection, not for regular access
* Access via `__dict__` bypasses Python's internal mechanisms

.4. Type Consistency
Check that what you retrieve is actually callable:

[source,python]
----
attr = getattr(Program, "some_attr")
if callable(attr):
    attr()
else:
    # Handle non-callable attribute
----

.5. Attribute Name Conflicts
Be careful with naming - callable attributes overwrite data attributes:

[source,python]
----
class Program:
    language = "Python"      # Data attribute
    
    def language():          # ❌ Overwrites the data attribute!
        return "Python"
----

.6. Accessing Class Attributes Inside Functions
Must reference the class explicitly:

[source,python]
----
class Program:
    language = "Python"
    
    def say_hello():
        # ✅ Explicit class reference
        print(f"Hello from {Program.language}")
        
        # ❌ Won't work - no implicit access
        # print(f"Hello from {language}")
----

.7. Distinguish from Static Methods
* These are NOT `@staticmethod` decorator methods
* These are simpler function objects attached to the class
* For actual static methods, use the decorator:

[source,python]
----
class Program:
    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        return "This is a proper static method"
----

=== Quick Reference Table
[options="header"]
|===
| Access Method | Use Case | Example
| Dot notation | Production code | `Program.say_hello()`
| `getattr()` | Dynamic attribute names | `getattr(Program, "say_" + name)()`
| `__dict__` access | Debugging only | `Program.__dict__["say_hello"]()`
| Function retrieval | Store for later use | `func = Program.say_hello`
|===

=== Key Takeaways
* Callable attributes are functions stored as class attributes
* Use dot notation (`Class.method()`) for clean, readable code
* These are not instance methods - no `self`, called on class directly
* `__dict__` access is for debugging only, not production code
* Be explicit when accessing class attributes inside these functions
* Check callability if attribute names come from dynamic sources
